So far I have learned basic command line
I have an understanding of how Git works and how to add projects to GitHub.
I feel comfortable using terminal from now on.
I need to get better with the few Git commands I have learned so far.

I know how to create the basic html file that contains the necessary information.

Now I will practice what I have learned so far.
